      <h4 class=''>Why do I need your services?</h4>
      <p>
        Number one, for peace of mind.  Theft, fire or flood damages can destroy your home and/or personal possessions and erase a lifetime of memories when least expected.  Trying to inventory from memory everything you have worked so hard for can be an overwhelming task and could cause delays in settling your claims or cause them to be incomplete.
        The coverage for your personal property on your insurance policy is allowable maximum payout.  To receive the maximum reimbursement, homeowners must provide proof of ownership for each and every item they claim was destroyed, stolen, etc.

      <h4 class=''>Why should I hire you when I can do this myself?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes, you can do this yourself, in fact we encourage you to do so.  We offer that option to you and provide you with some guidance and resources.  However, although with good intentions conducting a thorough inventory is a time consuming and tedious process that most people donâ€™t seem to accomplish.
